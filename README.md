# INVESTMENT_CALCULATOR-
Investment Calculator is a Python-based console application that helps users estimate the future value of their investments, including Systematic Investment Plans (SIP) and Lumpsum Investments. This tool is ideal for individual investors, students, or anyone wanting to understand investment growth over time through regular or one-time contributions.

Features:
SIP Calculator: Calculates the future value of monthly investments using compounding interest. The user inputs the monthly investment amount, annual return rate, and duration (in years), and the calculator projects the future value.
Lumpsum Calculator: Projects the future value of a one-time investment based on the initial amount, annual return, and investment duration.
Menu-Driven Interface: The user is presented with a menu to choose between SIP, lumpsum calculations, or exiting the program. The calculator loops back to the menu after each calculation for continuous use.
Exit Option: Allows users to exit the program when needed.

How It Works:
SIP Calculation: The future value is calculated using a monthly compounded formula, where the user provides monthly investment, annual rate of return, and years of investment.
Lumpsum Calculation: The future value is computed based on a single investment compounded annually for a set number of years.
After completing a calculation, the program returns to the main menu, allowing users to perform more calculations or exit.


Usage:
Clone the repository.
Run the script using Python 3.10+.
Choose between SIP or Lumpsum calculations, enter the required values, and view the future investment value.
Future Enhancements:
Add more investment types (e.g., recurring deposits).
Add error handling and a graphical interface for user convenience.
Investment Calculator is a helpful tool for understanding the potential growth of investments through compounding interest, giving users an easy way to project future returns.
